                        The Kingdom of Norway is a sovereign nation on the Scandinavian peninsula in northern Europe. It's pretty easy to pick out on a map.
                        Norway is known for its epic coastline the stretches from Sweden all around the southern and central mountains, and all the way up to the Russian border.
                        Denmark, Norway and Sweden together make up Scandinavia, while the Scandinavian countries plus Finland and Iceland are collectively known as the Nordic countries.

                        Scandinavia is characterized by common North Germanic heritage and culture, and a set of languages that are, to a large extent, mutually intelligible. So similar are the languages that some linguists argue that Norwegian, Swedish and Danish are really just strong variants of a standard Scandinavian language.

                        Administered by Norway, the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard contains some of the world's most remote communities. The land mass is vast, ranging from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. Learn more about living on Svalbard.
                        The Kingdom of Norway has a fascinating history that stretches far back before the Vikings.But of course, it's the Vikings that first spring to mind when most people consider Norwegian history. We get so many questions on the topic that we started our own Vikings blog. There, we cover topics as diverse as the timeline and major events, to what the people wore.

                        Norway's history is also intertwined with that of Denmark and Sweden, especially during the late Middle Ages. Various unions and wars with Denmark and Sweden have defined Scandinavia as we know it today.

                        Beauty being in the eye of the beholder is a wise adage, but it doesn’t apply to the Aurora Borealis, because the Aurora Borealis is a unique and beautiful creation from Mother Nature herself. Apart from its intrinsic beauty, the Aurora borealis is a combination of beautiful physical concepts blending together to bring about this fascinating phenomenon. An aurora, as it is commonly known, is also referred to as a polar light. The term “aurora borealis” indicates the aurora in the northern hemisphere, while the aurora seen in the southern hemisphere is known as the “aurora australis”. Before we get into the reasons as to why the aurora occurs, let’s first take a look at where they happen.
                        The northern lights, or the aurora borealis, are the beautiful dancing waves of light that have captivated people for millennia. But for all its beauty, this spectacular light show is a rather violent event. 

                        Energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's upper atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million km/h), but our planet's magnetic field protects us from the onslaught. As Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the North Pole, the dramatic process transforms into a cinematic atmospheric phenomenon that dazzles and fascinates scientists and skywatchers alike.
